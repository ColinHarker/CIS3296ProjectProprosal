# Mask Recognitian

## Project Abstract

During the covid-19 pandemic, wearing face masks has become a requirement all around the globe. This has presented some issues with some software that uses facial recogntion to unlock devices. This project aims to research the viability of developing a facial recognition system that works while a mask is on the users face. Using computer vision, we will develop methods to accuratly recognize someones face even through a face mask. With this being a research oriented project, there is a large possibility no solution or method will be found. Successful viability would aim to be greater than 95% accurate. The project will also determine potential use cases for this technology.

## Project Relevance
With almost every modern smart phone having a form of facial recognition, the ability to unlock your device while wearing a mask has effected millions of people since the start of the pandemic. This project not only deals with a subject extremely relevant to our everyday lives, but also presents as a great opportunity to dive further into computer vision techniques.

## Conceptual Design
Research will consist of developing software that is flexible in being able to test many facial recognition techniques as well as develop our own. A research paper will be created following development containing our findings and conclusion.

***Building***
- Project will be built using OpenCV and C++.  

**Running**
- Should have options to run code straight from command line, or have deployable app extension.
